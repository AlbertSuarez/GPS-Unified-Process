# GPS Unified Process (UP)

In my faculty, *BarcelonaTech* (FIB), I studied the *Unified Process* (UP) carrying out a project which was based on the "exchange of time". That is, instead of paying a service with money today, would be being able to pay with "time". For example, if I do one hour watering plants, one hour I can pay a locksmith to change me the door.

The project is done in Catalan and is composed of all parties must contain a Unified Process: **Business Case**, **Requirements Specification**, **Glossary**, **Software Development Plan**, **Iteration Plan**, **Risks and Vision**.

I did this work together with three university mates: Victor Perez, Pere Berg√© and Arnau Miralles. I leave the [Linkedin profile](https://es.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADctor-p%C3%A9rez-500011109/en) of the first one.

Thank you for your time and enjoy it!
